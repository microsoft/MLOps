    "Learn how to implement datasheets for machine learning assets using the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are datasheets\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasheets are a way to document machine learning assets that are used and created as part of the machine learning lifecycle. For example in the context of datasets, it can provide information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How and why a dataset was created\n",
    "- How the dataset should and shouldn't be used\n",
    "- Highlight potential ethical and legal considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is inspired by the electronics industry. It is standard for electronic components to include datasheets with information such as operating characteristics, recommended usage, and other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to datasets, datasheets can be used other machine learning assets used and created as part of the machine learning lifecycle. Models are such an asset where datasheets are extremely helpful. Models tend to be thought of as \"black boxes\" and often there is little information about them. Because machine learning systems are becoming more pervasive and are used for decision making, using datasheets is a step towards developing more responsible machine learning systems. Datasheets for models can help improve transparency by helping system developers think deeply about the systems they implement and provide users with the information on how a model was built as well as its intended use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasheets for models\n",
    "\n",
    "[Annotation and Benchmarking on Understanding and Transparency of Machine Learning Lifecycles (ABOUT ML)](https://www.partnershiponai.org/about-ml/), an initiative from the Partnership in AI (PAI), is a set of guidelines for machine learning system developers to develop, test, and implement machine learning system documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The current guidelines apply to models built using static data in models trained using various method such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The level of disclosure depends on whether the intended audience is external or internal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some model information you might want to document as part of a datasheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intended use\n",
    "- Model architecture\n",
    "- Training data used\n",
    "- Evaluation data used\n",
    "- Training model performance metrics\n",
    "- Fairness information. See the [fairness in machine learning article](./concept-fairness-ml.md) to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Azure Machine Learning SDK to implement datasheets for models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the machine learning training workflow, as part of the training process, once you have a trained model, you usually register it. As part of this registration process, you can include additional information about the model. Using the `tags` parameter in the [`register`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.model.model?view=azure-ml-py#profile-workspace--profile-name--models--inference-config--input-data-none--input-dataset-none--cpu-none--memory-in-gb-none--description-none-) method of the `Model` class.\n",

# Train and deploy a model using the CLI

The files in this directory demonstrate the following operations using the ML CLI:

* Installing the ML CLI extension for Azure CLI
* Creating an Azure Machine Learning workspace
* Creating a compute resource for training
* Defining and registering a dataset for training
* Starting a training run
* Registering a trained model
* Deploying the model as a web service
* Testing the web service by scoring example data

These actions are performed by the `train-model.sh` file in this directory.

For more information on how this example works, see the [Train and deploy a model from the CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/tutorial-train-deploy-model-cli) article.

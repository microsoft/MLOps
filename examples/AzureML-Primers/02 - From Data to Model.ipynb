Although it's fairly common for data scientists to work with data on their local file system, in an enterprise environment it can be more effective to store the data in a central location where multiple data scientists can access it. In this exercise, you'll explore some Azure ML features that make it easier to work with data in a high-scale, collaborative environment.\n\n> **Important**: This exercise assumes you have completed the previous exercise in this series - specifically, you must have:\n>\n> - Created an Azure ML Workspace, and saved its configuration in this Azure Notebooks project.\n>\n> If you haven't done that, do it now - it'll only take a few minutes!\n\n## Task 1: Connect to Your Workspace\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to connect to your workspace using the Azure ML SDK. Let's start by ensuring you still have the latest version installed (if you ended and restarted your Azure Notebooks session, the environment may have been reset)"

Now you'll use this same technique to train a model, but with one slight difference - rather than run the experiment code directly in this notebook, you'll create a separate Python script file. This enables greater flexibility in terms of the Python environment, or even the compute platform, on which the experiment code is to be run; and makes it easier you to manage experiment scripts in a source-controlled environment.\n\nFirst, let's create an experiment and a local folder into which we'll put the files needed to run it."
